#Startup Notes

Hello, welcome to my **notes**.

###2024.09.11

Today, I learned a lot about what a Git repository is, and how to use it. It's pretty fascinating that you can do all this just from the command line of your computer's terminal.

I also learned how to use GitHub, how to sync it with my computer, and how to quickly upload files from the terminal to the GitHub website.

Time to git good with all the `git` commands!
