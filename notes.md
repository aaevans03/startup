# Startup Notes

Hello, welcome to my **notes**.

Today, I learned a lot about what a Git repository is, and how to use it. It's pretty fascinating that you can do all this just from the command line of your computer's terminal.

I also learned how to use GitHub, how to sync it with my computer, and how to quickly upload files from the terminal to the GitHub website.

Time to get good with all the `git` commands!

Today, I set up my web server for my "startup" using AWS. It was really easy to set up a web service instance.

The IP of my server is `3.232.254.241`. An important thing for me to remember is how to log into my server's remote shell from my computer's terminal. It's pretty easy, I just need to type in the following:

`ssh -i [secret key pair file] ubuntu@3.232.254.241`

That's it for now!
